## BIO

I am a PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering Department. I received my undergraduate degree from Oregon State University in Bioengineering where I conducted research in computational chemistry under Dr. Cory Simon. After graduating, I worked at the NIH as a post-bac at the NCI Program for Natural Product Discovery (NPNPD). Here, I worked in an automation lab running, troubleshooting, and programming various robotic equipment and creating computer programs to assist the lab. Outside of academic activities, I like to make music, graphic design, and climb.

## Current Work

I am interested in leveraging sophisticated machine learning techniques to understand complex behaviors in animals. My research focuses on applying graph neural networks to two key areas:

1) Mosquito Behavior: Using graph-based models to decode how odors are processed in the mosquito brain, with the goal of facilitating the discovery of effective repellents.

2) Glassfish Schooling Dynamics: Exploring how graph neural networks can analyze schooling fish data to uncover patterns and insights into their collective behavior.

By bridging machine learning and neuroscience, I aim to contribute to innovative solutions and deepen our understanding of complex biological systems.
