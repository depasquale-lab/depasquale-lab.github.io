# BIO 

Omar grew up in Cairo, Egypt and received his B.E. degree in Biomedical Engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ, where he worked on a pediatric medical device for monitoring airflow following a tracheostomy. Currently a BME PhD candidate, co-advised by [Mike Economo](https://economolab.org), Omar is interested in understanding brain machine interfaces and investigating multi-region communication. Outside of work, he enjoys playing soccer, basketball, and tennis, traveling with family and friends, and playing Pro Clubs and COD.


# Current Work 

Omar is currently exploring the influence of Motor Cortex (Mtx) cell types on the dynamics of downstream subcortical regions within the brain's orofacial circuit. Through cell-type specific optogenetic perturbations, his research aims to investigate the role of a specific cell-type on sensory-guided movements, the neural dynamics within the Mtx that rely on each cell-type, and whether distinct cell types drive unique dynamics in downstream circuits. The goal is to understand how high level areas control the low level circuits involved in movements.
