## BIO
Zach grew up outside of Memphis, TN and completed his BS in Biomedical Engineering-Bioinformatics at the University of Missouri-Columbia. Before coming to BU, he helped develop artificial minichromosome-based gene editing systems in maize with Dr. James Birchler. Later, he studied the long term effects of radiation therapies on sleep electrophysiology and cognition at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital with Dr. Ranganatha Sitaram. At BU, Zach is co-advised with [Mike Economo](https://economolab.org/) and is interested in using state space modeling and subspace methods to study multiregion brain communication. Outside of lab, he enjoys playing soccer and tennis, hanging with his cat Watson, and playing videogames with friends. 

## Work
Zach is interested in the development and implemenetation of state-space models, such as switching dynamical systems, to study biological motor control. Currently, he is contributing to an open source codebase developed by the lab called [StateSpaceDynamics.jl](https://github.com/depasquale-lab/StateSpaceDynamics.jl.git) to increase accessibility of robust state-space modeling tools for neuroscience. On the application side, Zach is using Hidden Markov Model - Generalized Linear Models to study multiregional brain communication in the mouse motor system.
