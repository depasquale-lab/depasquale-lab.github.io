# Artificial and Biological Intelligence Laboratory at Boston University

The DePasquale lab is located in the [Department of Biomedical Engineering](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/biomedical-engineering/) at Boston University. We develop mathematical models to understand how populations of neurons perform computations to produce behavior. Broadly we take two approaches. One is data-driven: we collaborate with experimental neuroscientists to develop tailored machine learning models of neural activity to identify the algorithms that drive behaviors such as decision-making or movement. Our second approach is theoretical: we construct and analyze artificial neural network models to understand how their structure gives rise to analogous computations and other functional features observed in biological neural circuits.

Recent advances in machine learning methods for computational chemistry have opened exciting new avenues for understanding olfaction. We are utilizing graph neural networks and self-supervised learning to identify patterns in unlabeled molecular data, generating representations of odors that are useful for predicting olfactory sensory neuron activation. These learned representations more accurately predict how individual odor molecules interact with olfactory receptors compared to existing methods.

State-space models (SSMs) are powerful tools for modeling time series data that naturally arise in neuroscience, finance, and engineering. These models assume observations arise from a hidden latent sequence, encompassing methods like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Linear Dynamical Systems (LDS). Our group is actively building an open-course software packge to implement these models in Julia called StateSpaceDynamics.jl. This modular package designed to be fast, readable, and self contained for the express purpose of fitting a plurality of SSMs, easily in Julia.

Biological neural networks compute differently than most artificial neural networks used in machine learning. For example, although real neurons communicate with spikes, reproducing this feature in artificial models has been a challenge. We develop methods for training biophysically detailed neural networks and use thse models to understand how real biologial circuits compute. Through mathematical modeling, we focus on building tighter links between biologial neural networks and more abstract artifical neural network models used in machine learning.

Neural recordings from behaving animals are often much too complex to link directly to an animal's ongoing behavior. We develop machine learning models to analyze complex neural datasets to understand the algorithms that underlie different behaviors. We principally focus on the neural underpinnings of movement and decision making.
